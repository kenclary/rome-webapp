                <p>
                Citing security concerns surrounding last week's alleged nuclear
                explosion in Western Somalia, the Mogadishu Chamber of Commerce has
                blockaded all ports and land routes into the country.  Although there
                is no confirmation as of yet, it is believed that this action may be
                related to the recent terrorist attack that severed Somalia's
                fiber-optic connection to the world at large.  A UN special council
                has convened to discuss humanitarian aid.  Several Middle Eastern
                nations have pledged to oppose any 'blatant invasions masking as
                relief efforts,' leading the White House to officially state that it
                has 'no plans to put boots on the ground at this date.'
                    </p><p>
                Mogadishu has been a thriving corporate hub for the last ten years.
                Discovery of previously unknown rare-earth compounds has fueled
                unprecedented growth in the city's technology sector, aided by a
                lassez-faire regulatory regime.  Stock prices for corporations
                headquartered in the city have dipped slightly in reaction to the news
                and rumors of civil disturbance from unaffiliated militant factions
                located nearby.  The official unveiling of the Amazon.com Inc. space
                elevator project, housed just miles outside the city, has
                been indefinitely delayed by the news, but Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos
                has issued a statement that the project remains undamaged.</p>
